IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2018

**Abstract** This paper presents a robotic pick-and-place system that is capable of grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel objects. To achieve this, it first uses a category-agnostic affordance prediction algorithm to select among four different grasping primitive behaviors. It then recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain image classification framework that matches observed images to product images. Since product images are readily available for a wide range of objects (e.g., from the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without requiring any additional training data. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for a wide variety of objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves high accuracy for both known and novel grasped objects. The approach was part of the MIT-Princeton Team system that took 1st place in the stowing task at 2017 [Amazon Robotics Challenge](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/roboticschallenge).

Data is shared between the processes by reading and writing from RAMDisk.

# Suction-Based Grasping

A Torch implementation of fully convolutional neural networks for predicting pixel-level affordances (here higher values indicate better surface locations for grasping with suction) given an RGB-D image as input.

![suction-based-grasping](images/suction-based-grasping.jpg?raw=true)

## Quick Start

To run our pre-trained model to get pixel-level affordances for grasping with suction:

1. Clone this repository and navigate to `arc-robot-vision/suction-based-grasping/convnet`

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andyzeng/arc-robot-vision.git
    cd arc-robot-vision/suction-based-grasping/convnet
    ```

2. Download our pre-trained model for suction-based grasping:

    ```bash
    wget http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2017/arc/downloads/suction-based-grasping-snapshot-10001.t7
    ```

    Direct download link: [suction-based-grasping-snapshot-10001.t7 (450.1 MB)](http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2017/arc/downloads/suction-based-grasping-snapshot-10001.t7)

3. Run our model on an optional target RGB-D image. Input color images should be 24-bit RGB PNG, while depth images should be 16-bit PNG, where depth values are saved in deci-millimeters (10<sup>-4</sup>m).

    ```bash
    th infer.lua # creates results.h5
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    imgColorPath=<image.png> imgDepthPath=<image.png> modelPath=<model.t7> th infer.lua # creates results.h5
    ```

4. Visualize the predictions in Matlab. Shows a heat map of confidence values where hotter regions indicate better locations for grasping with suction. Also displays computed surface normals, which can be used to decide between robot motion primitives suction-down or suction-side. Run the following in Matlab:

    ```matlab
    visualize; % creates results.png and normals.png
    ```

## Training

# Parallel-Jaw Grasping

A Torch implementation of fully convolutional neural networks for predicting pixel-level affordances for parallel-jaw grasping. The network takes an RGB-D heightmap as input, and outputs affordances for **horizontal** grasps. Input heightmaps can be rotated at any arbitrary angle. This structure allows the use of a unified model to predict grasp affordances for any possible grasping angle. 

![parallel-jaw-grasping](images/parallel-jaw-grasping.jpg?raw=true)

**Heightmaps** are generated by orthographically re-projecting 3D point clouds (from RGB-D images) upwards along the gravity direction where the height value of bin bottom = 0 (see [getHeightmap.m](parallel-jaw-grasping/convnet/getHeightmap.m)).

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository and navigate to `arc-robot-vision/parallel-jaw-grasping/convnet`

    git clone https://github.com/andyzeng/arc-robot-vision.git
    cd arc-robot-vision/parallel-jaw-grasping/convnet
    ```

    ```

    Direct download link: [parallel-jaw-grasping-snapshot-20001.t7 (450.1 MB)](http://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2017/arc/downloads/parallel-jaw-grasping-snapshot-20001.t7)

3. To generate a RGB-D heightmap given two RGB-D images, run the following in Matlab:

    ```matlab
    getHeightmap;
    ```

4. Run our model on an optional target RGB-D heightmap. Input color images should be 24-bit RGB PNG, while height images (depth) should be 16-bit PNG, where height values are saved in deci-millimeters (10<sup>-4</sup>m) and bin bottom = 0.

    ```bash
    th infer.lua # creates results.h5
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    imgColorPath=<image.png> imgDepthPath=<image.png> modelPath=<model.t7> th infer.lua # creates results.h5
    ```

    visualize; % creates results.png
    ```

    ```

## Baseline Algorithm

Our baseline algorithm detects anti-podal parallel-jaw grasps by detecting "hill-like" geometric features (through brute-force sliding window search) from the 3D point cloud of an input heightmap (no color). These geometric features should satisfy two constraints: (1) gripper fingers fit within the concavities along the sides of the hill, and (2) top of the hill should be at least 2cm above the lowest points of the concavities. A valid grasp is ranked by an affordance score, which is computed by the percentage of 3D surface points between the gripper fingers that are above the lowest points of the concavities. To run our baseline algorithm over the testing split of our grasping dataset:

1. Navigate to `arc-robot-vision/parallel-jaw-grasping/baseline`

    ```bash
    cd arc-robot-vision/parallel-jaw-grasping/baseline
    ```
    
2. Run the following in Matlab:

    ```matlab
    test; % creates results.mat
    evaluate;
    ```

# Image Matching

A Torch implementation of two-stream convolutional neural networks for matching observed images of grasped objects to their product images for recognition. One stream computes 2048-dimensional feature vectors for product images while the other stream computes 2048-dimensional feature vectors for observed images. During training, both streams are optimized so that features are more similar for images of the same object and dissimilar otherwise. During testing, product images of both known and novel objects are mapped onto a common feature space. We recognize observed images by mapping them to the same feature space and finding the nearest neighbor product image match.
